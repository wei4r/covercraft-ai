# Resume Directory

Place your resume PDF files in this directory for the Cover Letter Agent to analyze.

## File Requirements

- **Format**: PDF only
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `john_doe_resume.pdf`)
- **Content**: Ensure your resume includes:
  - Contact information (name, email, phone, location)
  - Professional summary or objective
  - Work experience with specific achievements
  - Education details
  - Skills and certifications
  - Projects (if applicable)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use a well-formatted resume**: Clear sections, consistent formatting
2. **Include quantifiable achievements**: Numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
3. **Keep it current**: Recent experience and up-to-date contact information
4. **Avoid scanned images**: Text-based PDFs work better than image-based ones

## Example Usage

When running the agent, reference your resume like this:
```
Resume path: ./resume/your_resume.pdf
```

The agent will automatically extract and analyze all relevant information from your resume to create personalized cover letters.
